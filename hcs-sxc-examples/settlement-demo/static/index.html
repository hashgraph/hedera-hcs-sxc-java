                    With the Hedera Consensus Service you can develop applications like stock markets, audit logs, stable coins, or new network services that require high throughput and decentralized trust. This is made possible by having direct access to the native speed, security, and fair ordering guarantees of the hashgraph consensus algorithm, with the full trust of the Hedera ledger.
                    Consensus without compromise
                    Build natively
                    Create applications that are as fast as native services, because they take advantage of the native speed of the hashgraph consensus algorithm.
                    Amplify trust
                    Bring the full trust of the Hedera ledger to private networks, even if the members of the private network aren't trusted: the trusted nodes in Hedera amplify the trust of the private network.
                    Guarantee order
                    The Consensus Service uses hashgraph to put transactions into a consensus order, with fair timestamps, along with state proofs that guarantee it is correct.
                    Consensus Service API and network features
                    Topic Management

                    Topics make it simple to organize transactions, so each application only receives the messages it needs.
                    Consensus Order

                    Messages are put into consensus order and given a timestamp by the Hedera network, with cryptographic proofs, so they are as trustworthy as the full Hedera network.
                    Audit log

                    Messages are cryptographically tied together with a running hash to provide an auditable, tamper-proof log of history.
                    Scalable transactions

                    Message processing and storage are kept outside the Hedera network. This allows higher speed and scalability.
                    Low Fees

                    The high speed and good scaling ensure low, micropayment fees on par with Hedera Cryptocurrency.
                    Historical Data

                    The Hedera Consensus Service ensures speed and security are kept on the ledger while storage is kept off-ledger. Choose to keep everything, nothing, or anything in between.
                    “There are a number of challenges in using traditional ordering services for decentralized applications. By exposing this capability, Hedera is making a meaningful contribution to furthering the capabilities of distributed networks.”

                    Even if an application runs on a network that is not well trusted, that trust can be amplified by relying on the trusted Hedera ledger for the consensus ordering and timestamps. Track an item through a supply chain, provide a transparent bidding system, or process transactions, with auditable logs of the history.
